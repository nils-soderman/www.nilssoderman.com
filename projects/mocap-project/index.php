            This scene was a personal project made during my spare time at FutureGames. My goal was to learn how to work with Motion-Capture & MotionBuilder,
            as well as setting up a realtime cinematic sequence in Unreal Engine.<br>
            <br>
            The characters/rigs were borrowed from the <a class="text-url" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/assets?keywords=paragon" target="_blank">Paragon assets</a>.

             <div class="phone-title"><h3 class="smallTitle">Raw Mocap Data</h3></div>
             <div class="smallvid">
                <video autoplay loop muted controls>
                    <source src="https://nilssoderman.com/resources/videos/mocap-project/raw-data.mp4" />
                </video>
             </div>

             <div class="video-desc">
                 <h3 class="smallTitle">Raw Mocap Data</h3>
                 <p>
                    As I wasn't able to record any mocap data myself I searched through the internet + our school server and was able to find a few takes which inspired this idea.<br>
                    I then took these takes, applied them to the rigs and arranged them in Motionbuilder's story tool. I also matched the takes to make sure they were somewhat correctly placed in the world.

             <div class="phone-title"><h3 class="smallTitle">Blending Clips</h3></div>
             <div class="smallvid">
                <video autoplay loop muted controls>
                    <source src="https://nilssoderman.com/resources/videos/mocap-project/blending-clips.mp4" />

                <h3 class="smallTitle">Blending Clips</h3>
                <p>
                    Then it was time to start blending the clips together.
                    Here I was mostly looking at the timing while also trying to get the blends to look as good as possible, or at least to a state were I can work with them.<br>
                    <br>
                    If I had done it today I definitely would've spent a bit more time in story mode working on the blends, which could've helped save time + give a better final result.<br>

             <div class="smallvid">
                <video autoplay loop muted controls>
                    <source src="https://nilssoderman.com/resources/videos/mocap-project/correction-pass.mp4" />

                <h3 class="smallTitle">Correction Pass</h3>
                <p>
                    Once I had blends that was working I plotted everything down to the control rigs. I then started correcting some poses & movments to be closer to what I was after.<br>
                    I also began fixing most of the footsliding, to make this proccess easier I wrote a simple script (<a class="text-url" target="_blank" href="https://nilssoderman.com/code/motionbuilder-foot-sliding">Feet_Sliding.py</a>)
                    to copy the position from the previous frame and paste it on the current frame.
                    All footsliding was corrected on it's own layer so I later could turn down the weight of that layer in order still keep some of the original rotation in the feet, not giving them a dead feeling.

                 <p>
                    Here I made smaller tweaks, removing any pops & cleaned up some of the arcs. I also animated the hair, bag & the phone.<br>
                    For the hair I made a simple rig setup where I constrained some markers together, and the phone was just constrained to his hand until the end where I turned off the constraint &
                    animated it falling to the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the shot was ready I brought it into Unreal Engine 4 to light and render it.<br>
                    I used Unreal's cinematic sequence to setup the scene and animate the doors + the UV coordinates for the floor plan display.<br>

                I'd like to end this by give a special thanks to Jonas Wallin & Morris Belfrage for giving me some pro tips and tricks for MotionBuilder,<br> as well as Jack Parson for giving me some killer lighting tips.
